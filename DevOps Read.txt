log to see commit history
log --oneline all  comit hashcode history upto 7 charcater
git checkout "hashcode upto 7" - to view whats in that checkin   anf head will shift to this commit(not poiniting to any branch)
git checkout master - head will shift to master 
git restore filename - restore file to last checkin(means lost f eror whil editing n don know so get the last checkin from repo) and file back to head
git restore --source HEAD`digit filename   to restore checkin other than last may be last 3 or last 4 (give digit after tilde sign)
git restore --staged filename   to remove file from staging area (unstage)

git reset hashcode7digit   file will remove that commit from history but commited code will be there in file

git revert hashcode7digit    good practice to use and safe way to use reset as it creates new commit with the hashcode we give
